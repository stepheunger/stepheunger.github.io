Tips for Your Grand Opening</h3>

Last week, our team at BeatCreative Marketing opened our new office in style with a ribbon cutting ceremony and grand opening party. Check out some of our behind the scenes social media snapshots and then read how we can help you achieve similar results.
<br>
<br>
<h4>1. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION</h4>
Follow the top three rules of real estate when establishing your headquarters. The location of your office will set the tone for how your business develops. Want to gain interest through word-of-mouth and passers-by? Select a store front in a popular shopping area or a shop near a busy intersection. If you’d rather have a quiet haven to boost creative energy, try to find location near something you find inspiring: a body of water, museum, or park, perhaps.
<br>
<br>
<h4>2. GET WITH THE CITY</h4>
Now that you’ve found your perfect space, coordinate with your local Chamber of Commerce to conduct a ribbon cutting ceremony or sponsored grand opening party. Since the event will most likely go on the city’s event calendar, you’ll naturally gain more curious attendees and get a little free advertising.
<br>
<br>
<h4>3. PARTY LIKE IT’S YOUR BRAND’S BIRTHDAY</h4>
Keep your branding consistent in the selections you make for your grand opening party. From the colors to the refreshments to the entertainment, your brand should be represented in all aspects of the event. For example, if your company focuses on healthy living, it may not be a wise choice to serve pizza and cupcakes.
<br>
<br>
<h4>4. GO WITH THE FLOW</h4>
Identify the best floor plan for your location. Your party should have an easy flow to it that makes mingling easy. Are there certain elements that you want to highlight for your guests? Make sure important aspects of the party are in prominent places or put on display. Also, consider the elements: where can you place food and drink so it is not disturbed by wind, rain, heat, snow, etcetera?
<br>
<br>
<h4>5. TAP THAT RESOURCE</h4>
Of course, you want the BEST vendors for your grand opening party. Unfortunately, the best often comes at a price. If you’d rather not spend all of your hard-earned cash, make sure you consider your resources and connections. Do you have friends or family in the service industry? See if you can have them donate their time to bartend or pass hors d’oeuvres, or use their employee discount on catering. Can you barter your services to feature any of your clients?
<br>
<br>
<h4>6. TALK IT UP</h4>
Remember—PROMOTE! Make sure to e-blast your contacts, send your press release to local newspapers and magazines, create an event on Facebook, post frequently on social media leading up to the event, write blogs about your upcoming party, and tell everyone you meet! You can’t have too much promotion–this is a big deal!
<br>
<br>
<h4>7. IT’S ALL ABOUT THE DETAILS</h4>
The little details are so important to running a successful grand opening. Send personal invites to your VIPs and prospective clients. Include branded details wherever possible. Make your attendees feel special by offering goody bags or other takeaway. All of these touches will help you be on top of your game.
<br>
<br>
<h4>8. GO BIG OR GO HOME</h4>
Make your presence known! Launch your brand with a bang by using memorable, attention-grabbing effects. Add excitement (and close-proximity promotion) with a pop of a confetti canon, excitement of a balloon release, or blaze of searchlight for a nighttime event.
<br>
<br>
<h4>9. A PICTURE IS WORTH 1,000 MORE WORDS</h4>
Make sure you have a quality photographer and videographer at your event. Capturing the highlights will help you promote post-event. Attendees can reminisce about their favorite moments and people who missed the party can get still an idea of how amazing your company is.
<br>
<br>
<h4>10. IT’S NOT OVER UNTIL…</h4>
You follow up with your attendees! Send thank you notes to your vendors (either via e-mail or snail mail). Thank your clients for attending either personally, or through a dedicated e-blast. Most importantly, contact everyone who inquired about your company! Ideally, your grand opening party should solidify relationships and garner new ones.
